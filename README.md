## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following subfolders:

### 1. **Fundamentals**
   This folder covers the foundational concepts of Java programming. Topics include:
   - **Syntax and Semantics:** Learn the structure and flow of Java programs.
   - **Data Types and Variables:** Explore primitive and reference data types.
   - **Control Flow Statements:** Work with loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) and conditionals (`if-else`, `switch-case`).
   - **Functions and Methods:** Implement reusable methods, recursion, and method overloading.
   - **Exception Handling:** Understand error handling with `try-catch`, `finally`, and custom exceptions.

---

### 2. **OOPS Concepts**
   Dive deep into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles with examples and use cases:
   - **Classes and Objects:** Create classes, objects, and constructors.
   - **Inheritance:** Implement single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
   - **Polymorphism:** Utilize method overloading and method overriding.
   - **Encapsulation:** Work with access modifiers, getters, and setters.
   - **Abstraction:** Master abstract classes and interfaces.
   - **Interfaces:** Explore multiple inheritance through interfaces and functional interfaces.

---

### 3. **Collections**
   Learn about the **Java Collections Framework**, a powerful tool for managing data efficiently:
   - **Lists:** Examples of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.
   - **Sets:** Implementations of `HashSet` and `TreeSet` for unique element management.
   - **Maps:** Learn about `HashMap` and `TreeMap` for key-value pair operations.
   - **Queue and Stack:** Examples of `PriorityQueue`, `Deque`, and stack operations.

---

### 4. **Data Structures and Algorithms**
   This section provides implementations of essential data structures and algorithms:
   - **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree), and Graphs.
   - **Algorithms:**
     - Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
     - Sorting: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
     - Graph Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Includes practical coding exercises and optimizations.

---

### 5. **JDBC Project**
   Learn how to connect Java applications to databases using **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**:
   - **Setup:** Use the `mysql-connector-j` library to establish connections.
   - **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
   - **Practical Examples:** Real-world examples to demonstrate database interactions.

---

### 6. **VSCode Setup**
   This folder contains settings and configurations for using **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** with Java projects. It includes:
   - Launch configurations
   - Debugging settings
   - Tips for optimizing your development environment.
