# JAVA-Programming

This repository contains a collection of Java programming resources and code examples, organized into various subfolders. The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference for learning Java fundamentals, understanding data structures and algorithms, mastering collections, and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following subfolders:

### 1. **Fundamentals**
   This folder covers the basics of Java programming, including:
   - Syntax and semantics of Java
   - Data types and variables
   - Control flow statements (loops, if-else, switch-case)
   - Functions and methods
   - Exception handling

### 2. **OOPS Concepts**
   This folder contains examples and explanations of key Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation
   - Abstraction
   - Interfaces and Abstract Classes

### 3. **Collections**
   This folder includes detailed usage and implementation examples of Javaâ€™s Collection framework, such as:
   - Lists (ArrayList, LinkedList)
   - Sets (HashSet, TreeSet)
   - Maps (HashMap, TreeMap)
   - Queue and Stack implementations

### 4. **Data Structures and Algorithms**
   This folder focuses on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java, including:
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
   - Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
   - Searching and Sorting algorithms (Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS)
